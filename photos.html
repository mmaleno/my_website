<h3>Photos</h3>

<p>
This is the photos page.  Not really sure what I'll put on this page or how i'll structure it.  
I just know I want it on the site.  Maybe have a digital and analog page.  Maybe have photography tutorials?
</p>

<p>
I guess I'll start by making pages/folders for events I want to share online.  Maybe have a general astrophotography
page/folder, and maybe have a page for each vacation / event.
