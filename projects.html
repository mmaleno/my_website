<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>
This is the projects home page.  I'll list the projects i have material to publish on, and each project will link to their own page in the projects folder.
</p>

<p>
There are two main categories of projects: 1) academic and 2) personal.  Academic projects are a quick writeup about projects I took part in during my time
at Harvey Mudd College.  Personal projects are everything I have done outside of class, ranging from high school to the present day.  There are a few ongoing
personal projects that have their own folders with multiple writeups, such as my home network and custom darkroom.  Aside from these, each project has its own page.
