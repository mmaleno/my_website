<h3>Welcome to my humble site!</h3>

<p>I know it is not much, but I set out to build my own site with the goal of being fully self-sufficient;
this site is 100% built from scratch and hosted on my own hardware!  It has been a great learning experience
and has allowed me to apply simplicity to conveying information.  Enjoy! (another) Test for git
