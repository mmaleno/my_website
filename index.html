<p>Welcome to my humble website!  I know it is not much, but I set out to build this website with the goal of being fully self-sufficient in mind.
That means that I am 100% hosting this website on my own hardware, and this site is 100% built from scratch!  This had been a great learning experience and has allowed me to put my own creativity into the site.  Enjoy!
